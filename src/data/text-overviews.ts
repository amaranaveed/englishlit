Shakespeare wrote it c.1598–99 during a period of comedic experimentation, drawing on Italian sources while interrogating gender norms of his own society.",

      "Published in 1813 during the Regency period, the novel critiques the marriage market, entailment laws that excluded women from inheriting property, and the rigid class stratification of early 19th-century England. Austen uses free indirect discourse and irony to expose the gap between social performance and inner truth.",

      "Written c.1606 for King James I (who had survived the Gunpowder Plot), Macbeth explores the catastrophic consequences of regicide through the lens of Jacobean beliefs about divine right, witchcraft, and the Great Chain of Being. Shakespeare drew on Holinshed's Chronicles but transformed the historical Macbeth into a study of ambition, guilt, and moral disintegration.",

    contextSummary:
      "Published in 1843 during the height of industrialisation, the novella was Dickens' response to appalling poverty, exploitative child labour, and the punitive Poor Law of 1834. He chose fiction over polemic, believing stories could change hearts more effectively than pamphlets. The book helped shape the modern idea of Christmas as a time of generosity and social conscience.",

    ],
    contextSummary:
      "Written in 1945 but set in 1912, the play exploits the gap between these dates to create devastating dramatic irony. Priestley — a committed socialist — wrote it as the 1945 Labour government was creating the welfare state. The play is a political argument for collective responsibility, using the Birling family as a microcosm of a class system that Priestley believed had to change.",

    ],
    contextSummary:
      "Published in 1886, the novella reflects late-Victorian anxieties about evolution (Darwin), degeneration theory, and the rigid moral codes that demanded public respectability while concealing private vice. Set in London's fog-shrouded streets, it explores the duality of human nature through a Gothic lens, questioning whether civilisation's surface conceals a primitive self that science cannot control.",

    ],
    contextSummary:
      "Written c.1597, the play draws on Arthur Brooke's poem and explores Elizabethan tensions around arranged marriage, family honour, and youthful rebellion. Shakespeare subverts the Petrarchan love tradition while reflecting contemporary anxieties about patriarchal authority and street violence in rapidly growing cities.",

    contextSummary:
      "Written c.1611 and considered Shakespeare's farewell to the stage, The Tempest engages with early colonial encounters in the New World. Written during the expansion of the Virginia Company, it reflects Jacobean debates about mastery, servitude, and the ethics of empire, while the metatheatrical epilogue sees Prospero relinquish his art — often read as Shakespeare's own farewell.",

    contextSummary:
      "Written c.1596–98, the play reflects Elizabethan England's complex attitudes toward Jews (expelled in 1290, not readmitted until 1656) and the growing tension between mercantile capitalism and older feudal values. Shakespeare draws on anti-Semitic source material but complicates it, giving Shylock the famous 'Hath not a Jew eyes?' speech that demands recognition of shared humanity.",

      "Written in 1599, the play reflects Elizabethan anxieties about succession, political instability, and the ethics of deposing a ruler — topical concerns as the ageing, childless Elizabeth I neared the end of her reign.

      "Written in 1958 by 18-year-old Shelagh Delaney, the play is a landmark of the 'kitchen sink' realism movement. Set in the working-class terraces of Salford, it broke theatrical taboos by centring an interracial relationship, a gay character, and teenage pregnancy on a mainstream stage. Delaney wrote it after watching a Rattigan play and deciding she could do better — and she did, giving voice to communities and experiences that 1950s theatre largely ignored.",

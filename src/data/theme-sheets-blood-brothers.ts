    thesis:
      "Russell uses the separated twins as a controlled experiment to demonstrate that social class, not individual character or innate ability, determines life outcomes — presenting a socialist critique of Thatcher's Britain that argues inequality is manufactured by systems of privilege and deprivation, not by nature.",

              "The dropped 'g' in 'nothin'' maintains Mickey's working-class dialect even at this moment of crisis, showing that class identity is so deeply embedded it persists even when the speaker is challenging the class system itself.",
              "Russell echoes the Thatcherite rhetoric of individual responsibility by having Mickey confront Edward directly, but inverts its logic: Mickey's 'nothing' is not a personal failure but a systemic outcome that Edward's 'everything' depends upon.",

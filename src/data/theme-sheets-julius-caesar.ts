    theme: "Political Power & Ambition",
    thesis:
      "Shakespeare presents political power as inherently unstable and ambition as a force that corrupts even those who claim to act for the common good. Through Caesar's rise and the conspirators' violent response, the play exposes how the desire for power — whether to seize it or to prevent others from holding it — destabilises the state and destroys individuals.",

              "Shakespeare positions the warning in a public setting where Caesar dismisses it — his refusal to heed counsel reveals the arrogance that accompanies political ambition, a flaw that Elizabethan audiences would recognise as hubris.",
              "The brevity and simplicity of the warning contrasts with the elaborate political rhetoric elsewhere in the play, suggesting that truth about power is plain and direct, while those who seek power obscure it with language.",

              "The contrast between 'Colossus' and 'petty men' establishes a power imbalance that Cassius finds intolerable, and the word 'petty' is deliberately humiliating — Cassius weaponises resentment to recruit Brutus to the conspiracy.",

              "The comparative construction 'less... more' reduces the assassination of a friend to a simple equation of competing loyalties, and the rhetorical neatness conceals the moral chaos of what Brutus has done.",

            analysis: [
              "Brutus's wish to destroy Caesar's ambition without harming Caesar himself reveals the impossible contradiction at the heart of his position — political idealism cannot be enacted through assassination without becoming the violence it opposes.",
              "The word 'dismember' is viscerally physical, and Shakespeare forces Brutus to confront the bodily reality of murder even as he tries to elevate it to an abstract political act.",
              "This moment exposes Brutus's tragic flaw: he believes political power can be managed through moral reasoning alone, but the play demonstrates that once violence enters politics, it cannot be controlled or contained.",

            analysis: [

              "The word 'havoc' was a military command permitting soldiers to plunder and kill without restraint, and Shakespeare signals that the conspirators' political idealism has opened the door to chaos far worse than Caesar's rule.",

    thesis:
      "Shakespeare presents loyalty and betrayal as inseparable forces in Julius Caesar, demonstrating that in a world of competing allegiances — to friends, to principles, to the state — every act of loyalty to one cause necessarily constitutes a betrayal of another. The play explores how this impossible tension destroys individuals and fractures the political order.",

              "The brevity is devastating: Caesar does not rage or plead but simply accepts death once he sees Brutus among the assassins, suggesting that Brutus's betrayal, not the physical wounds, is what truly kills him.",
              "Shakespeare drew this line from classical sources but made it the emotional climax of the play, demonstrating that for Elizabethan audiences, personal loyalty was the supreme political virtue and its violation the most unforgivable act.",

            analysis: [
              "By calling Brutus 'Caesar's angel,' Antony invokes the language of divine protection and guardian spirits, elevating the betrayal from political treachery to a quasi-religious fall — the trusted protector becomes the destroyer.",
              "The word 'angel' carries deliberate irony: in Christian theology, the most devastating betrayal was Lucifer's — a trusted angel who rebelled against his lord — and Shakespeare invites the audience to see Brutus's treachery through this biblical lens.",

    theme: "Gender & Independence",
    thesis:
      "Bronte presents Jane Eyre as a radical challenge to Victorian gender norms, charting a heroine who refuses to surrender her autonomy for economic security or romantic love, and who insists that spiritual and intellectual equality between men and women is a moral absolute.",

              "The declarative sentence structure mirrors Jane's moral certainty, rejecting the Victorian expectation that children, and especially girls, should perform deference to their social superiors.",
              "Bronte uses the conditional clause 'if I were' to expose the hypocrisy of a society that values the appearance of affection over honest feeling, positioning Jane as an agent of truth against a culture of pretence.",
              "The directness of 'I declare' gives Jane a quasi-legal authority, anticipating the adult woman who will insist on her right to speak as an equal in a world that demands her silence.",

            act: "Chapter 2",
            analysis: [

              "Bronte's irony in 'bad opinion' exposes how Victorian society pathologised female anger, interpreting a child's justified resistance as moral deficiency rather than legitimate protest.",
              "The retrospective narration allows the adult Jane to reframe childhood punishment as the origin of her independence, turning a moment of powerlessness into a foundational act of selfhood.",

            analysis: [
              "The accumulation of self-deprecating adjectives — 'poor, obscure, plain, and little' — catalogues every reason Victorian society would dismiss Jane, before the emphatic exclamatory 'You think wrong!' demolishes them all.",
              "Bronte grounds equality not in social status or physical appearance but in the soul and heart, drawing on Evangelical Christianity's insistence that all souls are equal before God to challenge class and gender hierarchies simultaneously.",
              "The balanced phrasing 'as much soul as you — and full as much heart' creates syntactic equality on the page, performing through grammar the very parity Jane demands in life.",

            analysis: [

              "The theological image of standing 'at God's feet, equal' appropriates religious authority for a feminist argument, making Jane's claim to equality a matter of divine truth rather than personal opinion.",
              "The final dash followed by 'as we are' insists that this spiritual equality is not hypothetical or post-mortem but present and real, collapsing the distance between heavenly justice and earthly life.",

            analysis: [

            analysis: [

      "A Taste of Honey presents poverty not as a backdrop but as a shaping force that determines every relationship, aspiration, and possibility in Jo and Helen's lives, exposing a 1950s Britain in which working-class women are trapped in cycles of deprivation that society refuses to acknowledge.",

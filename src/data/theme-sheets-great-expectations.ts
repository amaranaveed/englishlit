    thesis:
      "Great Expectations exposes the Victorian obsession with social class as a destructive illusion, demonstrating through Pip's painful journey that ambition rooted in snobbery corrodes moral integrity and that true worth is found not in status but in loyalty, labour, and love.",

              "Estella reduces Pip to a catalogue of social deficiencies — his vocabulary, his hands, his boots — teaching him that class is inscribed on the body itself, not merely on behaviour.",
              "The tricolon of exclamatory sentences mirrors the accumulating weight of shame Pip internalises; each clause adds another marker of inferiority that he will spend the novel trying to erase.",

              "The phrase 'dear good fellow' is devastatingly ironic: Pip knows Joe's moral worth yet is still ashamed of him, exposing how class prejudice can override genuine love.",
              "Dickens critiques the mid-Victorian equation of social refinement with human value — Pip's shame is not a personal failing but the product of a system that teaches children to despise honest labour.",

            analysis: [
              "The ironic parallelism exposes gentlemanly life as a transaction in which maximum expenditure yields minimum value — wealth is consumed, not invested in anything meaningful.",

              "The dialect markers and the humble qualifier 'as I may say' contrast with the eloquent London society Pip aspires to, yet Joe's speech contains more genuine wisdom than any drawing-room conversation in the novel.",

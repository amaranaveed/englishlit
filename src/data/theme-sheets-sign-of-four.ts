            analysis: [

            analysis: [

    points: [

            analysis: [

            analysis: [
              "The 'sign of four' — a pact between Small and three Sikh accomplices — represents an unholy alliance forged by colonial greed, binding men across racial lines only through shared criminality.",
              "The irony of 'always stand together' is that the pact collapses entirely: betrayal, imprisonment, and murder follow, demonstrating that alliances built on stolen wealth cannot endure.",

            analysis: [
              "The dehumanising noun 'creature' strips Tonga of his humanity entirely, reducing him from a person to an animal — a rhetorical move that mirrors the imperial justification for subjugating colonised peoples.",

              "Conan Doyle, through Watson's narration, exposes how language itself becomes a tool of colonial violence — by naming Tonga a 'creature', the narrative pre-emptively justifies his killing.",

            analysis: [
              "The hyperbolic 'Never have I seen' presents Tonga as uniquely monstrous, erasing his individuality and replacing it with a racist archetype of colonial fear.",
              "The noun 'bestiality' continues the dehumanising animal imagery, while 'cruelty' projects moral judgement onto physical appearance — a hallmark of Victorian pseudo-scientific racism.",

              "The catalogue of suffering — 'misfortune', 'disaster', the loss of his leg — presents India not as the land of opportunity that imperial propaganda promised, but as a site of bodily destruction for ordinary British soldiers.",
              "The crocodile attack functions as a literal manifestation of colonial danger, but also symbolises how the Empire devours its own agents — Small is consumed by the very territory he was sent to control.",

              "Orwell echoes the language of the French Revolution's 'liberte, egalite, fraternite' and the early Bolshevik slogans, establishing that the novel is an allegory for how revolutionary ideals are systematically betrayed.",
              "The word 'equal' becomes the text's most contested term, as the pigs progressively redefine its meaning to exclude every species but themselves, demonstrating how language is the first casualty of authoritarian power.",

              "The economic language of production and consumption reflects Marxist theory about the exploitation of the proletariat, grounding the fable in real political philosophy.",
              "Orwell foreshadows that every accusation levelled at the human oppressors will eventually apply to the pigs, suggesting that corruption is not unique to any species or class but to the structure of unchecked power itself.",

              "The adjective 'enormous' and the violent verb 'bounding' create an atmosphere of terror, physically embodying the coercive power that replaces democratic debate once Napoleon decides to rule alone.",

            analysis: [
              "The 'peculiar sidelong look' suggests calculated premeditation rather than spontaneous disagreement, revealing Napoleon as a Machiavellian strategist who has been planning this coup from the beginning.",
              "The 'high-pitched whimper' is a signal to the dogs, reducing the overthrow of democracy to a dog whistle — Orwell literalises the metaphor of political manipulation as animal training.",
              "This moment parallels Stalin's expulsion of Trotsky from the Soviet Union in 1929, and Orwell captures how dictators disguise calculated power grabs as responses to supposed threats.",

            analysis: [

              "The oxymoron 'more equal' is Orwell's sharpest satirical weapon — equality is by definition absolute, so the phrase exposes totalitarian language as deliberate nonsense designed to paralyse rational thought.",

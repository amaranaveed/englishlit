    thesis:
      "Lord of the Flies argues that civilisation is not an inherent quality of humanity but a fragile, artificial construct that collapses when external structures of authority are removed — revealing the innate savagery that lies beneath the surface of even the most 'civilised' individuals.",

              "The rhetorical question appeals to reason and logic, establishing Ralph as the voice of civilisation who understands that rescue depends on sustained, cooperative effort rather than impulsive action.",
              "The fire functions as a symbol of connection to the adult, civilised world — maintaining it requires discipline, self-sacrifice, and the ability to defer gratification, all hallmarks of civilised behaviour that the boys progressively abandon.",
              "Golding, writing in the shadow of WWII, uses the fire as a test of civilisation's durability: the boys' inability to maintain it mirrors how quickly societies can collapse when collective responsibility is abandoned.",

              "The national pride implicit in 'We're English' reflects post-colonial assumptions about British superiority that Golding, having witnessed the brutality of supposedly civilised nations during WWII, seeks to demolish.",
              "The conjunction 'After all' reveals that Jack treats civility as a matter of identity rather than effort — he believes civilisation is something the English inherently possess, which makes his descent into savagery all the more powerful as Golding's counter-argument.",

            analysis: [
              "The simultaneous destruction of the conch and the death of Piggy — the novel's representative of reason and intellect — literalises the collapse of civilisation: both rational thought and democratic order are destroyed in a single act of violence.",
              "The verb 'exploded' and the phrase 'ceased to exist' convey irreversible annihilation — Golding does not allow the conch to merely break but has it shatter completely, signalling that civilisation cannot be gradually eroded but is violently obliterated.",
              "Roger's act of pushing the boulder is deliberate and unprovoked, demonstrating that savagery is not merely the absence of civilisation but an active, destructive force that seeks to annihilate the structures of order.",

            analysis: [
              "The transformation from 'laughter' — a human, social expression — to 'snarling' — an animalistic, predatory sound — captures in a single sentence the regression from civilised boy to savage hunter.",

              "The adjective 'awesome' in its original sense of inspiring awe and fear signals that Jack's transformation is not merely behavioural but almost supernatural — the paint does not disguise him but reveals a deeper, more primal self.",
              "Golding draws on anthropological ideas about masks and ritual identity: the painted face allows Jack to act without personal moral responsibility, anticipating the deindividuation observed in WWII atrocities where uniforms enabled ordinary people to commit violence.",

            analysis: [
              "The asyndetic list — 'screamed, struck, bit, tore' — removes conjunctions to create a breathless, frenzied rhythm that mirrors the uncontrollable momentum of mob violence, each verb more savage than the last.",
              "Simon is referred to as 'the beast' rather than by name, revealing that the boys' projection of evil onto an external creature has become a self-fulfilling prophecy — they create the very violence they feared by attacking the one person who could have saved them from it.",
              "Golding deliberately sets the murder during a storm and a ritual dance, echoing both primitive sacrifice and the crowd psychology that enabled mass atrocities during WWII — civilisation does not merely fade but is actively overwhelmed by collective savagery.",

              "The gentle, almost serene language describing the parachutist's departure contrasts starkly with the brutal frenzy of Simon's murder, highlighting the gap between the imagined external threat and the real internal one.",

              "The adjectives 'understandable' and 'lawful' reveal what Ralph values in leadership: comprehensibility and rules, both of which are cerebral qualities that cannot compete with the visceral excitement Jack offers through hunting and ritual.",

              "The pronoun 'We' creates an in-group identity defined by strength and action ('we hunt'), contrasting with Ralph's intellectual appeals; Jack offers belonging and purpose, which are more emotionally compelling than reason.",

            analysis: [

              "Robert's matter-of-fact tone shows how quickly the boys have normalised authoritarian violence — the absence of shock or protest demonstrates that fear has replaced conscience as the governing principle of the group.",

              "The phrase 'pack of painted savages' reduces Jack's tribe to their animalistic behaviour, but this rational critique has no persuasive power against a group that has already abandoned rational evaluation.",

              "The invisible circle around Henry represents the residual conditioning of civilisation — Roger wants to hurt the smaller boy but is still restrained by 'the taboo of the old life,' the internalised rules of the society he has left behind.",
              "The verb 'dare not' reveals that Roger's restraint is not moral but social — he refrains from violence not because he believes it is wrong but because he fears punishment; once that fear is removed, nothing will prevent his cruelty.",
              "Golding uses Roger to argue that civilisation's power lies not in transforming human nature but in constraining it — the 'space' around Henry is the distance between civilisation and savagery, and it is shrinking throughout the novel.",

              "The description of Simon's murder uses the vocabulary of animal predation — 'teeth and claws' — revealing that the boys have become the very beast they feared, fulfilling the novel's central irony.",
              "The phrase 'no words' signals the complete collapse of language and reason — the boys have regressed beyond speech into pure, inarticulate violence, the antithesis of the democratic assemblies that once governed them.",
              "Golding structures the novel so that the boys kill Simon at the precise moment he comes to tell them the beast is harmless — they destroy the truth-teller rather than face the truth, a pattern Golding recognised from political history.",
